**Title: teachers day poem?**</br>

This is a Story</br>
on my first day at school</br>
i felt nervous</br>
but very very cool</br>
i was very very shy</br>
whenever the sf's asked for a reply</br>
then i saw my ft's</br>
Ms Ng and mdm Sim</br>
the first impressions of them</br>
ms Ng was friendly, and very very kind</br>
Mdm Sim was kind very very </br>
when i was asking her for something</br>
i swear i heard</br>
****Oh! Your approaching me?***</br>
although this was later proved false for she is very very, um... </br>
patient and kind. But always on her phone</br>
They may be very contrasting in size...</br>
But I was sure...</br>
They were both great teachers</br>
The end</br>
